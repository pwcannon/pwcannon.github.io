Hi there! I'm Patrick. Welcome to my personal website.

I'm a machine learning researcher, and currently lead the research and engineering function of a computer vision startup I co-founded in early 2023. 

Previously, I worked at [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) where I focused on simulation-based inference methods (like normalising flows) for calibrating complex scientific simulators, including agent-based models.

I have a PhD in statistics from the University of Bristol, where I worked on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference in coalescent population genetic models, supervised by [Christophe Andrieu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=kcsbLrAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Mark Beaumont](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=2K3F0MMAAAAJ).

Broadly, my interests lie in probabilistic machine learning and its use in solving important technological and scientific challenges. Guided by a statistical worldview, I try to leverage the tools of uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding of black-box algorithms, particularly deep learning. I'm mostly concerned with:

ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Robust deep learning  
ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Algorithmic trustworthiness  
ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Alignment  

I believe these are some of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence and, as a result, are not only technically interesting but highly consequential for humanity.
