Hi there! I'm Patrick. Welcome to my personal website and [blog](./blog.html).

I'm a machine learning researcher, and currently lead the research and engineering function of a computer vision startup I co-founded in early 2023. 

Previously, I worked at [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) where I focussed on simulation-based inference methods (like [normalising flows](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/db0eac6747e3631eb91095cd76065611-Abstract-Conference.html)) for calibrating complex scientific simulators, for example agent-based models.

I have a PhD in statistics from the University of Bristol, where I worked on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference in coalescent population genetic models, supervised by [Christophe Andrieu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=kcsbLrAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Mark Beaumont](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=2K3F0MMAAAAJ).

Broadly, my interests lie in probabilistic machine learning and its use in solving important technological and scientific challenges. Informed by a statistical Weltanschauung, I'm most interested in using the tools of uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding of black-box algorithms, like deep learning, and to thereby improve the conforming of these algorithms to human preferences. In paricular, I take an interest in
