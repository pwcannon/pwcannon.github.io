Hi there! I'm Patrick.

I'm a machine learning researcher currently working on multimodal speech generation at Amazon.

Previously, I co-founded a computer vision startup where I had fun working with NeRFs and Gaussian splats. I also worked at [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) where I developed simulation-based inference methods (like normalising flows) for calibrating complex scientific simulators, including agent-based models.

I have a PhD in statistics from the University of Bristol which focused on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference in coalescent population genetic models, supervised by [Christophe Andrieu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=kcsbLrAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Mark Beaumont](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=2K3F0MMAAAAJ).

Broadly, my interests lie in probabilistic machine learning and its use in solving technological and scientific challenges. In most of my work I've tried to leverage the tools of uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding of black-box algorithms, particularly deep learning. I'm particularly excited by:

ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Robust deep learning  
ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Algorithmic trustworthiness  
ðŸ”˜ &nbsp; Alignment  

I believe these are some of the most pressing challenges in AI and it's important we get them right.
